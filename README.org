#+TITLE: Org-Babel support for evaluating bean-query queries

Refer to the Babel [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Working-with-Source-Code.html][documentation]] in the Org manual and to the
dedicated [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/index.html][section]] on Worg for instructions on how to use this. There
just a few bean-query specific aspects, listed below.

** Header arguments

The ~:colnames~ header argument defaults to ~yes~.

There are a few bean-query specific headers arguments:

- ~:db~ ::

  The path to the Beancount ledger on which bean-query will
  operate. This argument is required.

- ~:errors~ ::

  Setting this argument to ~no~ is equivalent to passing the
  ~--no-errors~ command line option to the ~bean-query~ command.
  
- ~:numberify~ ::

  Setting this argument to any value is equivalent to passing the
  ~--numberify~ command line option to the ~bean-query~ command.

** Sessions

There is currently no support for sessions.
